# Data science projects

This project is part of the learning process of data science. The datasets used in the sub projects were got from various sources. This project was done to increase familiarity with dataframes, pandas and numpy concepts.In some projets, matplot python library has also been used for data visualization, this was done to increase familiarity with data manipulation.

### Description of the projects
Each directory has a diffrent project and data set with its own analysis requirements. The data set is contained in the .csv file extensions through out the directories. Each directory has its own data set. The README.md in each contains the analytical requirements of the datasets and a brief description of the datasets. The actual analysis is found in the files with .ipynb extension. 

The process in  almost all the analysis is data reading, data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization.

### Technologies used
* The main language that was used was python 
* Python numpy - used for arithmetic calculations and manipulations
* Pandas - For dataframe manipulation 
* Matplot  - For data visualization eg. graphs, pie charts
* Notebooks - The codes were written notebook cells.
